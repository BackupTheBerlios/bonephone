Installing pre-compiled binaries
--------------------------------

Binary releases of RAT are standalone, and do not require the installation
of other libraries to function correctly. 

The Windows 95/98/NT binary is a self-extracting installer, double-click on
its icon and follow the instructions.

The Unix versions are distributed as tar archives compressed with gzip. The
archive contains documentation files and binaries which can be installed as
follows:
	tar zxvf rat-4.2.3-solaris2.7.tar.gz
	cd rat-4.2.3
	./rat-4.2.3-installer
at this point you will be asked to read the license agreement. If you accept
the license terms, a second tar/gzip archive will be generated. You should
then install this using:
	tar zxvf rat-4.2.3-solaris2.7.tar.gz
	install -m 755 rat-4.2.3       /usr/local/bin
	install -m 755 rat-4.2.3-ui    /usr/local/bin
	install -m 755 rat-4.2.3-media /usr/local/bin
replacing "4.2.3-Solaris" with the version number and platform of your choice.
Note:
  1) The front-end binary ("rat-4.2.3" in this example) can be renamed if
  desired. The application will not work if the other binaries are renamed.
  2) All three binaries must be installed in a directory in your search path.
If you have the sdr program, you should also install the supplied sdr plugin 
according to the instructions for sdr.


Compiling from source code
--------------------------

To compile RAT from source you MUST download and compile the following
additional packages:
	The UCL common multimedia code library
	The UCL distribution of tcl-8.0
	The UCL distribution of tk-8.0
These can be downloaded from http://www-mice.cs.ucl.ac.uk/multimedia/software
or, if you have access to the UCL CVS server, you should fetch the modules
common, tcl-8.0 and tk-8.0.

On Windows 95/98/NT you should install the packages in c:\src. The entire
package can be built using Visual C++ 6.0 with the rat.dsw workspace, there
is no need to separately compile common, tcl-8.0 and tk-8.0.  Ensure that
you select the correct configuration when compiling (rat win32 release, for 
example). To compile the IPv6 version, you need the Microsoft Research IPv6 
stack; this must be downloaded separately.

On Unix you should build the tcl-8.0, tk-8.0 and common packages before
attempting to compile rat. You should then build rat as follows:
	./configure
	make
The compilation process requires that all four packages are installed below a 
common directory. A distribution binary package can be built with the command
	make tgz
The configure script takes the following options:
	--enable-debug		build a binary with debug symbols
	--enable-debug-mem	build a binary with memory debugging
	--enable-profile	build a binary with profiling information
	--enable-bounds		compile with array bounds checking (requires a
				modified gcc which supports this)
Further options may be available - use "./configure --help" for details.

On SGI Irix, you may need to specify the "--x-libraries=/usr/lib32" option
to configure.

If you need to modify the source to build RAT on your platform, please send
these modifications to rat-trap@cs.ucl.ac.uk for incorporation in future
releases.

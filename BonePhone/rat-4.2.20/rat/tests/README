The files in this directory are for testing modules of RAT.  They do
not necessarily stay in sync with source code.  However, if you add a
codec, renderer, whatever, the test applications should provide the
kind of treatment the modules get inside of RAT.  If you add a new
kind of module, then whatever you use for debugging may usefully be
added here.

Projects
	- Write a configure script.
	- Add more tests.

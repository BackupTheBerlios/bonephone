UCL Common Code Library

Routines common to a number of multimedia tools.  The library
originates from work on the RAT project: these are portions that are
not directly related to an audio tool and potentially useful
elsewhere.  

This library is required to build RAT v3.2.7 or later, and may be
needed for other UCL tools.

0.8.2  * removed a bug that caused the audio engine to start with in/out 
         volumes of zero. Users had to move the volume sliders to set the 
         correct volume. This should be fixed now.
       * added hack to have no empty Subject lines appear. This confuses the 
         message parser in a way that a JAIN exception is thrown when reading
         an empty Subject line. This is avoided by mapping empty subjects to
         the String "empty". Nevertheless this bug will get triggered again
         when using something else than bonephone to call in.

0.8.1  * Added "AutoAnswer" feature (tested)
       * wrote README.config
       * README.config and Changelog are now part of the main archive
       * replaced SIP-UA with a new version from Stefan Foeckel 
         (foeckel@fokus.gmd.de)

This package has network related objects that are common to both SIP and SDP.
There are classes here for host names and IP addresses that are filled in
by the host_nameParser and sip_urlParser that are implemented 
in gov.nist.sip.msgparser package.  Right now this package is somewhat 
minimal but it will grow substantially with time.

<body>
This is the NIST implementation of the JAIN-SIP interfaces.  

<p>
The stack is configured initially via a configuration file (configfile) 
which resides in the directory of the application. 
JAIN does not define a standard way in which to configure the
 stack. We opt for a simple keyword-value based configuration method
 (clearly an xml-based scheme would be cleaner).

<p> The file "configfile" in the directory where the main class 
 (i.e. application) resides has configuration parameters for the stack:

 <pre>
 authenticationMethod methodName methodClass  [parms]
 specifies a supported authentication method.

 traceLevel level
 Specifies the debug trace level (32 is the max trace level)
 
 enableUDP port#
  Specifies that UDP is supported on port#
 
 enableTCP port#
  Specifies that TCP is supported on port#

  stackHostName name
  Specifies a host name (could be a DNS pseudonym) for the stack.
  
 stackAddress address
  Address of host where stack resides.
  This is a required parameter.

 parseSDP
  Add this line if you want to parse sdp part of the header. However,
  in order to access the sdp part, you have to access the implementation
  (NIST-SIP) object until an API for sdp headers becomes defined.
 
 serverLog logfileName
  File name where the log is written.
  
 enableRecordRoute
  Add the record route header when forwarding requests.

 defaultRoute string
  Set the default route (used by gov.nist.sip.stack.DefaultRouter)
  This has the form hostName:port/Transport
  The router is consulted to get a list of addresses in order of priority
  that are tried in order to send an outgoing message.

 router className
  set a default router. The default router should implement the
  gov.nist.sip.stack.Router interface.  The algorithm specified in the
  router returns a prioritized list of addresses for routing outbound
  sip requests



  Here is an example configfile:
 
  traceLevel 32
  stackHostName nist.gov
  authenticationMethod Digest gov.nist.sip.stack.security.DigestAuthenticationMethod passwords
  serverLog myLogfile
  stackAddress 129.6.55.64
  enableUDP 5061
  enableUDP 5060
  defaultRoute is2.antd.nist.gov:5060/UDP

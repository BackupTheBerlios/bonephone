<blockquote>
<h2>
<u>What's in this Distribution?</u></h2>
This distribution contains :

<ul>
<li> A public domain extensible, modular&nbsp; JAVA based message
parser for the <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/sip/papers.html">Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP/SDP).&nbsp; </a>SIP is an IETF&nbsp; text based
signaling protocol for IP Telephony and&nbsp; internet conferencing.&nbsp;
The distinguishing features of this parser are (1) It uses&nbsp; a parser
generator&nbsp; to build the parser rather than ad-hoc techniques.&nbsp;
This makes the syntax clear, extensible and easy to debug.&nbsp; (2) It&nbsp;
incorporates flexible exception handling for bad headers, giving an application
fine grained control over how to deal with mal-formed headers and (3) It
incorporates an extension mechanism to deal with new header types.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The core parser&nbsp; handles headers that are part of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2543.txt">SIP
RFC 2543</a>&nbsp; and the 2543-bis02 draft revision standard and there
are header classes defined for these.&nbsp; The grammars that are parsed
by this package are represented in BNF like form by generating HTML from
the parsers. To get an approximate idea what they look like,&nbsp; you
can click on
<a href="sip_messageParser.html">SIP grammar</a> and <a href="sdp_announceParser.html">SDP
grammar</a>&nbsp; .
<br>&nbsp;

<li> A simple <a href = "gov/nist/sip/stack/package-summary.html"> stack </a> 
with <a href = "gov/nist/sip/stack/security/package-summary.html">security support</a>.

<li> An implementation of the <a href = "gov/nist/jain/protocol/ip/sip">
JAIN-SIP 1.0 interfaces </a> on the basis of the NIST-SIP parser and stack.

<li> Examples that illustrate the use of this library including 
a simple <a href="../../examples/proxy/README.html"> proxy server </a> 
with firewall support.

</ul>

<h2>
<u>Installation</u></h2>
You can untar the distribution anywhere in your file system.
<p>1. Install the latest version of java JDK  
   <a href="http://www.javasoft.com/j2se/1.3">JRE 1.2
or higher </a>.
<br>2. Include the following two files in your&nbsp; CLASSPATH :&nbsp;
nist-sip.jar and&nbsp; lib/antlr/antlrall.jar&nbsp;&nbsp; 
(file names are relative to the root of the distribution tree).
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<u>How do I use it?</u></h2>
The parser is intended to be embedded in a SIP protocol stack or test tool
and for building sip extensions.&nbsp;&nbsp; The parser takes as input
either a buffer or an input stream and produces as output a parsed message
structure. The stream based parser is intended to be used when TCP is used
as the transport and the buffer based parser is intended to be used when
UDP is used as the transport mechanism (SIP can be used over both TCP and
UDP).
<p>Here is an&nbsp; <a href="../../examples/msgparser/PipelinedParserTest.java">example</a>&nbsp;
that uses the stream based parser&nbsp; (<a href="gov/nist/sip/msgparser/PipelinedMsgParser.html">PipelinedMsgParser</a>)&nbsp;
that reads from stdin, parses input and outputs the result to stdout (typically,
that input would come from a TCP connection). A class that implements the<i><a href="gov/nist/sip/msgparser/SIPMessageListener.html">SIPMessageListener</a></i>
interface is specified when the parser is created. This interface specifies
two methods <i><font color="#000099">processMessage</font> </i>and <i><font color="#000099">handeException</font></i>
that are invoked by the parser on successful message processing and when
a parse exception is encountered respectively. The exception handler gets
passed a <a href="gov/nist/sip/msgparser/SIPParseException.html">SIPParseException&nbsp;</a>
object that indicates the type of error that occured. The handleException
method can do whatever is appropriate for the application such as&nbsp;
rejecting the header silently, propagating the exception or&nbsp; repairing
the error by&nbsp; "hand-parsing" the header.&nbsp; When a message has
been successfully parsed,&nbsp; the <i><font color="#000099">processMessage</font></i>
method is called from the parser and it is passed a <a href="gov/nist/sip/msgparser/SIPMessage.html">SIPMessage</a>
object corresponding to the input that has been read from the input stream.
<p>Here is an <a href="../../examples/msgparser/StringParserTest.java">example</a>
that uses the&nbsp;&nbsp; buffer&nbsp; based parser (<a href="gov/nist/sip/msgparser/StringMsgParser.html">StringMsgParser
</a>).&nbsp;
This example reads a file consisting of multiple messages&nbsp; into&nbsp;
a buffer (typically, that input would be from a UDP packet) and parses
the input by handing that input to the parser.&nbsp;&nbsp; The parser can
take multiple SIP Messages in a single buffer and&nbsp; returns the parsed
result as an array of&nbsp; <a href="gov/nist/sip/msgparser/SIPMessage.html">SIPMessage</a>&nbsp;
objects.&nbsp; Errors are handled&nbsp; via a class that implements the
<i><a href="gov/nist/sip/msgparser/SIPParseExceptionListener.html">SIPParseExceptionListener</a></i>.
that can be registered at the time of creation of the parser with the <i>set<font color="#000099">ExceptionListener</font></i>&nbsp;
method of the <a href="gov/nist/sip/msgparser/StringMsgParser.html">StringMsgParser</a>.
This class must implement the <i><font color="#000099">handleException</font></i>
method that functions as described above. As&nbsp; above, the&nbsp; exception
listener can be set up to customize error handling by introsepcting on
the Exception class that it is passed when an exception occurs.
<p>In both cases above, the input was&nbsp; based on parsing entire SIP
Messages&nbsp; (request or response) and the&nbsp; output of the parse
is a 
<a href="gov/nist/sip/msgparser/SIPMessage.html">SIPMessage</a>
object.  This structure may be accessed using the provided
assessor methods to retrieve individual headers or lists of headers. 
The header classes, SIPMessage class and SDPAnnounce class also provide API 
for editing and encodinginto canonical form. 
(This facility is useful for proxies.). Headers may be retrieved
in an array or list corresponding to the order in which they were added
to the SIPMessage using 
the <i><font color="#000099">getHeaders</font>&nbsp;</i>
method exported by the 
<a href="gov/nist/sip/msgparser/SIPMessage.html">SIPMessage</a>
class. The parser may&nbsp; also be used to parse portions of&nbsp; SIP
Headers, and&nbsp; URLs.&nbsp; Here is an
<a href="../../examples/msgparser/SIPURLParserTest.java">example</a>
that illustrates parsing of individual URL's and here is <a href="../../examples/msgparser/SIPHeaderParserTest.java">another
</a>that
illustrates parsing of individual headers.&nbsp; More callouts to the&nbsp;
parser to parse individual pieces of input may be added as needed by adding
methods to or extending <a href="gov/nist/sip/msgparser/StringMsgParser.html">StringMsgParser.</a>
<p>The parser incorporates an extension mechanism to support&nbsp; header
types that are not part of the RFC 2543. Here is an <a href="../../examples/msgparser/NewHeaderTest.java">example</a>&nbsp;
that&nbsp; handles extension headers that are not part of the&nbsp; SIP
RFC. Extensions are stored in a hash table in the SIPMessage and can be
retrieved by type by using the <i><font color="#000099">getExtensionHeader</font></i>
method of the <a href="gov/nist/sip/msgparser/SIPMessage.html">SIPMessage</a>
class&nbsp; by specifying the class of the extension header.

<p>The parser may also be used to parse SDP headers. This is not particularly
relevant for building servers but may be of use in building UAC clients.&nbsp;
You can turn on parsing SDP headers by setting the parseMessageContent
flag in the SIPMessage structure or by invoking the sdp parser separately.
If this flag is not enabled, the message content&nbsp; is just returned
to the caller as un interpreted text.&nbsp; Here is an <a href="../../gov/nist/sip/examples/msgparser/SDPParserTest.java">example</a>
of how to do it by separate invocation of the parser.

<p>
A minimal <A href="../../examples/proxy/README.html"> proxy </A> with firewall 
support illustrates the use of the nist-sip stack and message parser to 
construct a proxy. 
(This proxy is missing some important functionality but it can handle 
the simple case of point-to-point calls through a firewall and its purpose 
is to be illustrative rather than full functional.)

<h2>
<u>Build&nbsp; Instructions</u></h2>
The distribution comes with a jar file containing the parser. However,
if you wish to modify it,&nbsp; you will need the following software installed
to be able to build the parser:
<p>1. <a href="http://www.javasoft.com/j2se/1.3">Sun&nbsp; Java Development
Kit JDK 1.3</a>
<br>2. Optinally&nbsp; install the full&nbsp; <a href="http://www.antlr.org">antlr
parser distribution</a>.
<br>3. Install Gnu make ( ships standard with linux. for windows, install
the <a href="http://www.sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin">cygnus toolkit )</a>
<br>4. Edit the configuration file 
<a href="../../build-config"> build-config </a> at the root of the 
distribution tree &nbsp; and set the appropriate paths&nbsp;
to the installed JDK (mine lives at /usr/local/jdk1.3.1 under linux).
<p>To build everything, from the root of the distribution, make all (this
will generate nist-sip.jar).&nbsp; To build&nbsp; just the the parser,
go over to gov/nist/sip/msgparser and&nbsp; gmake all . The detailed operation
of the parser and lexical analyzer can be turned on enabling the -trace
flag to antlr (uncomment the ANTLR_FLAGS line in the <a href="../../gov/nist/sip/msgparser/makefile">makefile
)</a>
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<u>Release Status</u></h2>
This is (and will remain) beta code.
&nbsp; More extensive testing is needed.
Do not use this code it to signal your neighborhood nuclear reactor!
&nbsp;
The XML file 
&nbsp; <a href="../../examples/torture/torture.xml">examples/torture/torture.xml</a>&nbsp;
has&nbsp; xml based&nbsp; torture tests.
Currently, these tests include the messages from the call flows document 
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-call-flows-04.txt" >
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sip-call-flows-04.txt
</a>,
<a href=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/%7Ehgs/sip/bakeoff/testmsg.html   >
Henning Schulzerinne's SIP Bakeoff test messages 
</a> and messages that came out of various user agents. 
To build  and run these tests you need to have the java 
<a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces/index.html">xml&nbsp; parser</a>&nbsp; 
(a version of which has been included in &nbsp; <a href="../../lib/xerces/">lib/xerces/</a>&nbsp;).  
The tests are
also illustrative of the behavior of the parser under various conditions
and the syntax of the xml file is self-explanatory. We request you, the
people, to add more test cases and report bugs as they arise. 
<h2>
<u>Implementation Notes</u></h2>
In general, parsing SIP headers using parser tools is tricky because keywords
are context sensitive.&nbsp; Here are a few&nbsp; brief <a href="design-notes.html">implementation
notes&nbsp;&nbsp;</a> that explain how the parser was put together. It
may be of use in extending it.
<h2>

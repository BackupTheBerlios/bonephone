This is a simple container for JAIN services. The container engine is
configured using the configfile in this directory. Services are built by
extending the JAINService class. You can register (potentially several)
services for tcp and udp. These services are specified in the services
file that is given to the engine on startup. Each service is a JAIN
listener. The engine loads the service on startup. 

1. build the default target:
	make

2. Open up two windows.

3. From the first window:
 	make tests

4. From the second window

	cd ../shootist/
	make shootme

This sends a number of messages to the Service.

If you dont like the ports I have assigned, please edit configfile.

Make sure the defaultRoute in shootist matches accordingly.

The passwords file is for authentication (The configfile specifies
Digest authentication. Currently, the Digest authentication scheme just
stores plain text passwords. This will be changed in future. )

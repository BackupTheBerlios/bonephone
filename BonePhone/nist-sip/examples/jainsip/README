Jainsip examples:

container contains my ideas on how to build a higher level abstraction
(like servlets) on top of jainsip. These are just my ideas and not
a servlet implementation!

simple contains the simple example that is from the jainsip documentation.

shootist (inspired by the John Wayne movie of the same name) contains a 
Shootist that will send messages up to the server (for example, a REGISTER
from a UAC to the server).

Change to these directories and take a look at the README files therein and
please let mranga@nist.gov know if the bed bugs bite.

The configuration of the JAIN stack is done via a file called configfile which
resides in the directory from where the listener is run.

See gov.jain.protocol.ip.sip.SipStackImpl documentation for how to configure
the file.

Note that the jain architecture and api are still evolving (not finalized yet).

To run examples.jain.shootist on two different machines, you need to modify
shootist/message_simple.txt (especially the via line).

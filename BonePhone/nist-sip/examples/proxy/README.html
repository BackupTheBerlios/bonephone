<P><font size="5"><b>Summary</b></font></P>

<P>This package  contains the code for  a simple proxy  using the NIST
SIP stack  and message parser.  It  is intended as  a demonstration of
the  capabilities  to  build  a   useful  piece  of  code.  The  proxy
incorporates  a   mechanism  to  deal  with   firewall  control  under
Linux..&nbsp; <font color="#0000FF">This
is EXPERIMENTAL code so don't  use this proxy to  perform 
remote-controlled brain surgery, no  matter how much you are tempted 
to do so.&nbsp;</font></P>

<P>Here is a list of features and limitations of this proxy that could be of
interest:</P>

<ul>
  <li>Authentication methods can be configured. There is an architected&nbsp;
    means of&nbsp; writing your own method. When <I>configured to do so</I>,  this  proxy  is  able  to  handle  local
registration with  either basic  or digest authentication  methods&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Extension mechanism to deal with unknown headers. This is illustrated in
    this proxy by an extension parser that can deal with Session-Timer headers.</li>
  <li>Architecture permits adding location methods. At this time we have not
    implemented any location methods (such as LDAP search)&nbsp; but maybe  in a later  version
    we will do so.</li>
  <li>Has a mechanism that can deal with NAT and firewall traversal. The code
    provided here&nbsp; currently works only with LINUX firewalls but the
    general mechanism can be implemented for any type of firewall.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Does not handle Multicast (may be added later).</li>
  <li>Does not handle Forking requests&nbsp; (may be added&nbsp; later).</li>
  <li>Does not re-transmit requests (may be added later).</li>
</ul>

<H3><A NAME="Usage"><b>Usage</b></A></H3>

<P>To start the proxy:

<PRE>java ServerMain -configFile configfile</PRE>

where <I>configfile</I> is the name of your configuration file.

<H3><A NAME="ConfigurationFile">Configuration file</A></H3>

<P>The  proxy  understands   several  configuration  tags.   Some  are
required, some are optional.  They can always be disabled by putting a
<I>#</I> sign  at the beginning  of their line.   Here is the  list of
configuration tags, with explanations.</P>

<UL>

<LI><B><A NAME="BasicFeatures">Basic features</A></B>

<UL>
<LI><A NAME="enableUDP"><B>enableUDP</B></A> :  takes a port number as
argument. Use  it to enable SIP  over UDP on the  specified port.  The
proxy can handle both TCP and UDP at the same time. Default is <b>enableUDP 5060</b>

<LI><A NAME="enableTCP"><B>enableTCP</B></A> :  takes a port number as
argument. Use it to enable SIP  over TCP the specified port. The proxy
can handle both TCP and UDP at the same time. By default TCP is disabled.

<LI><A  NAME="stackName"><B>stackName</B></A> :  takes  a hostname  as
argument.  Use  it to define  the hostname associated with  the stack.
This is the address that will appear in the Via headers for example.

<LI><A NAME="stackAddress"><B>stackAddress</B></A>  : takes a  list of
IP addresses as arguments.  In the general case, a proxy has 2 or more
network  interfaces. In  most cases,  it is  enough to  give  just one
address to the  SIP proxy in the configuration  file.  However, in the
case  of a  proxy  sitting on  a  network boundary  and  which is  not
colocated with a gateway, the  proxy has to know about those different
addresses,  because  it  will  necessarily  be  reached  by  different
interfaces (the external ones and  the internal ones).  In the case of
a proxy colocated  with a gateway, it can always be  reached by one of
the external addresses without specific problems.

</UL>

<LI><B><A
NAME="RegistrationAuthenticationFeatures">Registration/Authentication
features</A></B>

<UL>

<LI><A NAME="disableAuthentication"><B>disableAuthentication</B></A> :
use it to disable authentication.  The default behaviour for the proxy
is to ask for authentication.

<LI><A   NAME="registrationTimeout"><B>registrationTimeout</B></A>   :
takes  a  number (in  seconds)  as argument.   Use  it  to define  the
registration timeout.  A  thread is in charge of  removing the outimed
registrations.

<LI><A NAME="maxRegistrationTimeout"><B>maxRegistrationTimeout</B></A>
: ??

<LI><A  NAME="authenticationMethod"><B>authenticationMethod</B></A>  :
takes  three arguments.   First,  the type  of authentication  method,
which can be either <I>Basic</I>  or <I>Digest</I>.  Then, the name of
the  class which  handles  the authentication  method,  and finally  a
password file.  Note that  there can be  multiple occurrences  of this
tag.

<LI><A
NAME="defaultAuthenticationMethod"><B>defaultAuthenticationMethod</B></A>
:   takes  one  argument   which  can   be  either   <I>Digest</I>  or
<I>Basic</I>.   Use it  to  define the  default authentication  method
method  called when  a client  tries to  register without  sending any
registration authentication header.

<LI><A
NAME="allowMultipleRegistration"><B>allowMultipleRegistration</B></A>
: use  it to  enable support for  multiple registrations for  a single
user.  Be aware that this option is yet incompatible with firewall/NAT
transversal (and  again, this might be  fixed in a  later version when
forking will be implemented).

</UL>

<LI><B><A NAME="DebuggingFeatures">Debugging features</A></B>

<UL>

<LI><A  NAME="serverLog"><B>serverLog</B></A> :  takes  a filename  as
argument. Use it to catch the traces on a file.  Use it in conjunction
with <I>traceLevel</I> and <I>enableDebug</I> tags.

<LI><A  NAME="enableDebug"><B>enableDebug</B></A> :  use it  to enable
the printing of debugging messages.

<LI><A  NAME="traceLevel"><B>traceLevel</B></A> :  takes  a number  as
argument.&nbsp; This is an integer that can vary between 0 and 32&nbsp; (default
  0) that controls the amount of log information written out to the serverLog
  file.

</UL>

<LI><B><A NAME="LoggingFeatures">Logging features</A></B>

<UL>

<LI><A  NAME="accessLogViaRMI"><B>accessLogViaRMI</B></A> : Use  it to
enable access to logged messages via RMI.
<B> Make sure your RMI registry class path includes 
nist-sip/gov/nist/sip/stack so that the logging classes can be 
located by it </B>

<LI><A  NAME="rmiRegistryPort"><B>rmiRegistryPort</B></A> : use  it to
define the  port used  by the RMI  registry (default is  1099). Useful
when multiple  SIP proxies are running  on the same  machine, each one
can have its own RMI registry.

<LI><A NAME="rmiPort"><B>rmiPort</B></A> : use  it to define the port
used to  access the messages logs  via RMI.  Useful when  the proxy is
behind a  firewall. The default behaviour  for RMI is to  use a random
port, which is not firewall friendly.

<LI><A NAME="traceLifeTime"><B>traceLifeTime</B></A>  : Takes a number
in seconds as  argument. Use it to define the  lifetime of each single
trace.

</UL>

<LI><B><A NAME="RoutingFeatures">Routing features</A></B>
When an invite comes into the proxy, it forwards the invite as follows

<UL> 

<LI>If a forwarding address is REGISTERED with this proxy then forward
it there else </LI>

<LI> If the SIP URL refers directly to a host and port, then forward
the request there else </LI>

<LI> Call the default routing algorithm to determine the next hop (if a
forwarding proxy has been registered with the stack then the default
routing algorithm just returns a string with this information). The
proxy interprets this string to be a host:port/transport string and
forwards the request there else </LI>

<LI> return an error to the sender.


<P>
At this time, we do not support location search (via LDAP). We will probably
add such features at a later date.

The default location to forward the request is specified by
<B> defaultRoute host:port/TRANSPORT </B>
For example:
<PRE>
defaultRoute crowbar.ncsl.nist.gov:5060/UDP
</PRE>

<LI>router routerClassName<LI>

An override for the default Routing algorithm. You can specify the name
of a class that implements gov.nist.sip.stack.Router. (If nothing is specified,
gov.nist.sip.stack.DefaultRouter is used.)

</P>
</LI>

</UL)


<LI><B><A NAME="GatewayFeatures">Gateway features</A></B>

<UL>

<LI><A  NAME="gatewayAddress"><B>gatewayAddress</B></A> : takes  an IP
 address as argument. Most of the time, when the proxy and the gateway
 are colocated, it  will be the same as the  stack address.  But, when
 they  are  not, and  if  the  gateway is  doing  things  like NAT  or
 firewalling, then  the proxy has to  know the address  of the gateway
 for NAT and firewall transversal.

<LI><A NAME="enableRecordRoute"><B>enableRecordRoute</B></A>  : use it
when you want the proxy to  add a Record-Route header in every message
forwarded.  This is to force proxying.

<LI><A  NAME="removeContactHeaders"><B>removeContactHeaders</B></A>  :
use it when you want the  proxy to remove the Contact headers from all
forwarded  messages.  This  is  against  the RFC  and  should  not  be
used.  However,  it  is  useful  in  some  cases  to  force  proxying.
Normally, the Record-Route header  overrides the Contact header.  But,
since some clients  do not know about that, the only  way to make them
work    (for    example,    for    testing   purposes)    through    a
proxy/gateway/firewall/NAT/whatever is to  remove the Contact headers.
But, always remember that it is best not to use this tag.

<LI><A NAME="innerNetworkPrefix"><B>innerNetworkPrefix</B></A> : takes
a list of  network prefixes as argument. Use it when  the proxy has to
deal with  either a firewall  or NAT or  both of them. This  allow the
proxy to know when a  message is transversing the firewall/NAT and has
then to perform  some manipulations on the message  (like changing the
inner  network address  in the  SDP fields  of a  message) or  to send
commands to  the firewall  (like opening  a hole in  order to  let the
media streaming go  through).  For example, if there  are two networks
behind  the firewall/NAT,  192.168.1.0 and  192.168.2.0, the  tag will
look like this: <PRE>innerNetworkPrefix: 192.168.1. 192.168.2.</PRE>

</UL>

<LI><B><A      NAME="FirewallAndNATFeatures">Firewall      and     NAT
features</A></B> (gateway features must be configured first)

<UL>

<LI><A   NAME="firewallTransversal"><B>firewallTransversal</B></A>   :
takes  two file  names as  arguments. Use  it to  define  the commands
called for (argument  number 1) opening holes in  the firewall and for
(argument  number  2)  closing  the  previously opened  holes  in  the
firewall.  This  tag has  also the effect  of activating  the firewall
transversal support in the proxy.

<LI><A
NAME="firewallPortTranslation"><B>firewallPortTranslation</B></A>     :
takes a port number as argument.   Use it to direct all the media flow
through a specific  port number in the firewall.   This is useful when
one wants  to have  all the firewall  rules concerning SIP  media flow
defined (like shaping, logging, etc ...) in a single set.

<LI><A NAME="natTransversal"><B>natTransversal</B></A>  : use this tag
to activate the NAT transversal support.

<LI><A NAME="requireTimer"><B>requireTimer</B></A> : use this tag when
you  want  the  proxy to  add  a  'Require:  timer' to  any  forwarded
message. This feature is related to the SIP Session Timer draft.  This
is  useful  for  firewall/NAT  transversal,  as,  for  many  different
reasons, sessions might  not always be properly ended.   The proxy has
then to have a  mean to know when to close a  session.  It's up to the
clients  to send from  time to  time re-INVITE  to keep  their session
open.   If they  don't, then  the proxy  assumes that  the  session is
closed. Be aware that, with this tag you might frequently get an error
response  from clients, as  many of  them still  do not  implement the
session   timing.    You  may   then   have   to   rely  on   the   <A
HREF="#defaultSessionTimeOut">following</A> tag.

<LI><A NAME="defaultSessionTimeOut"><B>defaultSessionTimeOut</B></A> :
Takes a  number in seconds as  argument. Use it to  define the default
session timeout.  Useful when  sessions are not closed properly, which
actually  happens quite  often,  and/or none  of  the clients  handles
session timer.   If you plan to use  the proxy with a  firewall, it is
recommended to use the session timer. You may decide to get rid of the
<A HREF="#requireTimer">requireTimer</A>  tag, but you  better use the
present one with a reasonably low value.

</UL>

<LI><B><A NAME="OtherFeatures">Other features</A></B>

<UL>

<LI><A NAME="parseSDP"><B>parseSDP</B></A>:
Enables parsing of sdp headers. (You need this if you want to 
enable firewall/NAT control).

<LI><A NAME="janitorSleepingPeriod"><B>janitorSleepingPeriod</B></A> :
Takes  a number  in seconds  as argument.  Use it  to define  the time
between  each  periodical cleaning.  This  concerns  call records  and
registration records among other things.

<LI><A NAME="locationSearchEnabled"><B>locationSearchEnabled</B></A> :
use it to  enable message forwarding by location  search.  If enabled,
when  forwarding a  message, after  having unsuccessfully  checked the
registration records, the  proxy would then try to  send it to another
proxy which might know what to  do with it.  Be aware that this option
is yet incompatible the  firewall/NAT transversal (this might be fixed
in a later version ...).

</UL>

</UL>


<H3><A NAME="CommonScenarios">Common Scenarios</A></H3>

<P>The  proxy  usage  will  now  be  explained via  a  set  of  common
scenarios. They are of gradual difficulty and it is recommended to try
them in order.</P>

<OL>

<LI><B><A NAME="SimpleUsage">Simple Usage</B></A>

<P>In  that  case,  we  use  just  the  call  forwarding  feature  (no
registration) and no gateway performing NAT or firewall stands between
the caller and  the callee. There are three  parties in this scenario,
that is Client A calls Client B via the proxy.

<P>The only relevant configuration tags in this case are:</P>

<UL>

<LI><A          HREF="#enableUDP">enableUDP</A>          or         <A
HREF="#enableTCP">enableTCP</A>, whether you want to use UDP or TCP or
both of them. If you are going to run the proxy and one of the clients
or both  of them on  the same machine,  remember to choose  well their
listening ports to avoid conflicts.

<LI><A HREF="#stackName">stackName</A>  : put the name  of the machine
running the proxy

<LI><A  HREF="#stackAddress">stackAddress</A>: put the  address(es) of
the machine running the proxy

</UL>

<P>Here is a configuration file example for this scenario:</P>

<PRE>
enableUDP 5060
stackName celtic.antd.nist.gov
stackAddress 129.6.50.27
</PRE>

<P>Then configure the calling client to  use the proxy, and dial on it
the  address  of the  callee  either  in  the form  <I>address</I>  or
<I>address:port</I> if the callee is  not listening on the default SIP
port (5060).</P>

<LI><B><A         NAME="RegistrationWithoutAuthentication">Registration
without authentication</B></A>

<P>This  scenario is similar  to the  <A HREF="#SimpleUsage">first</A>
one. Only,  here, client B will  first register under  a certain name,
and then Client A will call it via the proxy using that name.</P>

<P>Use the  same configuration as in  the <A HREF="#SimpleUsage">first
scenario</A> and add the following tags:</P>

<UL>

<LI><A   HREF="#disableAuthentication">disableAuthentication</A>:   to
disable authentication

<LI><A  HREF="#registrationTimeout">registrationTimeout</A>: to define
a time out for the  registrations. Note that, though recommended, this
is not necessary.

</UL>

<P>Here is a configuration file example for this scenario:</P>

<PRE>
<font color="#0000FF">enableUDP 5060
stackName celtic.antd.nist.gov
stackAddress 129.6.50.27
disableAuthentication
registrationTimeout 3600</font>
</PRE>

<P>Then configure  Client A  and Client B  to use the  proxy, register
Client B  on the  proxy with a  certain and  dial this name  on Client
A. The proxy should then forward the call to Client B.</P>

<LI><B><A    NAME="RegistrationWithAuthentication">Registration   with
authentication</B></A>

<P>This       scenario      is       similar      to       the      <A
HREF="#RegistrationWithoutAuthentication">second</A> one.  Only, here,
the proxy will ask for authentication when client B registers.

<P>Use     the     same     configuration     as     in     the     <A
HREF="#RegistrationWithoutAuthentication">second   scenario</A>,   but
remove the disableAuthentication tag and add the following tags:</P>

<UL>

<LI><A    HREF="#authenticationMethod">authenticationMethod</A>:    to
define a authentication method with its handler and its password file.

<LI><A
HREF="#defaultAuthenticationMethod">defaultAuthenticationMethod</A>:
to define the authentication method that the proxy will use for
  WWW-Authentication headers.

</UL>

<P>Here is a configuration file example for this scenario:</P>

<PRE>
<font color="#0000FF">enableUDP 5060
stackName celtic.antd.nist.gov
stackAddress 129.6.50.27
registrationTimeout 3600
authenticationMethod Digest gov.nist.sip.stack.security.DigestAuthenticationMethod passwords
authenticationMethod Basic  gov.nist.sip.stack.security.BasicAuthenticationMethod passwords
defaultAuthenticationMethod Digest
</font></PRE>

<P>The NIST  SIP Stack comes with  handlers for both  Basic and Digest
authentications,        which        are,       respectively        <A
HREF="../../gov/nist/sip/stack/security/BasicAuthenticationMethod.java">gov.nist.sip.stack.security.BasicAuthenticationMethod</A>
and                                                                  <A
HREF="../../gov/nist/sip/stack/security/DigestAuthenticationMethod.java">gov.nist.sip.stack.security.DigestAuthenticationMethod</A>.
which are supported in the proxy. You may wish to write your own authentication
method. Note  that  this  is  part of  the  <A
HREF="#ExtensionMechanisms">extensions mechanisms</A>.</P>

<P>The  password file  consist of  a  list of  name/password with  the
format name:realm:password (for now, passwords are plain text but 
that will change). Here is an example:</P>

<PRE>
bednarek:nist.gov:foobar
3019758220:nist.gov:foobar
</PRE>

<P>Then    follow    the    same    procedure    as    in    the    <A
HREF="#RegistrationWithoutAuthentication">second   scenario</A>.   The
only difference is that the user  agent for Client B should prompt for
password (if it is not already in a configuration file somewhere) when
registering.</P>

<LI><B><A NAME="NATTransversal">NAT Traversal</A></B>

<P>For those who  do not know, NAT (Network  Address Translation) is a
technology that  allow to have a  whole IP network behind  a single IP
address, or  at least  a limited set  of IP addresses.  Every outgoing
packet has  its origin  address changed to  those of the  gateway when
passing  through it.  The gateway  is then  in charge  of  routing the
packets properly on the way back. NAT is useful and widespread, but it
causes  problems  to protocols  which,  from  a  given session,  start
another sessions. SIP  is one of them, as it  typically starts a media
session between the caller and the callee.</P>

<P>In such a  case, a proxy can help. In this  scenario, we will study
the  case  where  the  proxy   and  the  NAT  performing  gateway  are
colocated.</P>

<P>The  first  task  is  to  configure the  gateway  features  of  the
proxy. The relevant tags, here, are:</P>

<UL>

<LI><A HREF="#gatewayAddress">gatewayAddress</A>  : to tell  the proxy
where the gateway  is. Here, it is the same address  as the proxy. Put
the external address rather than  the internal one, since this address
must be globally routable.

<LI><A  HREF="#innerNetworkPrefix">innerNetworkPrefix</A>:  to  define
the inner  network, so  that the  proxy can detect  when a  message is
transversing the gateway and when it is not.

<LI><A  HREF="#enableRecordRoute">enableRecordRoute</A>:   use  it  to
force proxying, as some clients may  try to bypass the proxy which, in
this  case, definitely  need to  catch the  SIP messages  in  order to
perform some changes on it.

</UL>

<P>Then, the NAT feature itself:</P>

<UL>

<LI><A HREF="#natTransversal">natTransversal</A> : to activate the NAT
transversal support.

</UL>

<P>Here is a configuration file example for this scenario:</P>

<PRE>
<font color="#0000FF">enableUDP 5060
stackName caribou.antd.nist.gov
stackAddress 129.6.55.81 192.168.3.1 
gatewayAddress 129.6.55.81
innerNetworkPrefix 192.168.3. 192.168.2.
natTransversal
enableRecordRoute
</font></PRE>

<P>Then,  if Client  A and  Client  B are  standing apart  from a  NAT
gateway  running the  SIP  proxy, they  should  be able  to call  each
other. In the case of Client  A standing outside the inner network and
Client B  inside, the  correct procedure is  to register Client  B and
then  to  call  it  under  that  name  from  Client  A  (Refer  to  <A
HREF="#RegistrationWithoutAuthentication">scenario    2</A>    or   <A
HREF="#RegistrationWithAuthentication">scenario 3</A> for registration
configuration). It is also possible  for Client A to dial directly the
IP address  of Client  B to  call it, but  external peers  are neither
supposed to use internal addresses nor to know them.</P>

<P><B>NB</B>:  This  has been  successfully  tested  under Linux  with
either SNAT (Static Network Address Translation) or Masquerading.  Any
other  test  <A  HREF="mailto:nist-sip-dev@antd.nist.gov">reports</A>,
whether successful or not, are welcome.</P>

<LI><B><A
NAME="Non-colocationWithAGatewayPerformingNAT">Non-colocation  with  a
gateway performing NAT</A></B>

<P>This case  is pretty similar  to <A HREF="#NATTransversal">scenario
4</A>. Only  here, the proxy will not  sit on the same  machine as the
gateway. You can take exactly  the same kind of configuration and just
remember to set up properly the gateway address.</P>

<P>Here is a configuration file example for this scenario:</P>

<PRE><font color="#0000FF">

  <P><B>NB</B>: This  has been successfully tested with  a Linux gateway
performing SNAT  (Static Network Adress  Translation) or Masquerading.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

  <P><B><A NAME="FirewallTransversal">Firewall Traversal</A></B>

  </P>

  <P> The Proxy only provides means of interaction with a firewall. It
is  up to  the user  then to  handle these  interactions  properly via
scripts or  programs. Included are&nbsp; scripts that  run under Linux
kernel            2.4             &nbsp;            with            <A

<P>Two different methods can be used when dealing with a firewall:</P>

<OL>

<LI><B><A NAME="PortOpeningMethod">Port Opening Method</A></B>

<P>With this method, ports are opened in the firewall when the session

define   the  scripts  that   will  handle   port  opening   and  port
closing. When  called, these scripts will  receive a list  of peers in
<I>address:port</I>  form. The  script  has then  to  send the  proper
commands  to the firewall  to open  (or close)  holes in  the firewall
between all of theses peers.

<LI><A  HREF="#defaultSessionTimeOut">defaultSessionTimeOut</A>:  this
is related to the implementation of the SIP Session timer draft, which
requires clients  to periodically  send re-INVITE in  order to  keep a
session  open.  This  is extremely  useful for  firewall-compliant SIP
proxies.   This  provides  a  mean   of  closing  a  session  and  its
corresponding holes  in the  firewall when it  is not  properly ended.
With this tag, you can define  a default time out, in case the clients
do not  handle session timing or  if, for some reason,  the session is
not closed properly.

<LI><A HREF="#requireTimer">requireTimer</A>: this  is also related to
the implementation of the SIP  session timer draft. With this tag, the
proxy  tells the  clients that  at  least one  of them  has to  handle
session timing. Some  clients do not understand this  header, and send
back an error message. Thus, you might decide not to use it at all and
just rely on the previous one.

<P>Here is a configuration file example for this scenario:</P>

<PRE>
<font color="#0000FF">enableUDP 5060
stackName caribou.antd.nist.gov
stackAddress 129.6.55.81 192.168.3.1 
gatewayAddress 129.6.55.81
innerNetworkPrefix 192.168.3. 192.168.2.
firewallTransversal openPort.pl closePort.pl
defaultSessionTimeOut 120
requireTimer
enableRecordRoute
</font></PRE>

<P>In this example,  we use two Perl scripts to  open and close ports,
respectively    <A     HREF="openPort.pl">openPort.pl</A>    and    <A
HREF="closePort.pl">closePort.pl</A>.  They are made  to be  used with
the  firewall defined  in  <A HREF="firewall.sh">firewall.sh</A>.  All
these   files  can   be  found   in  the   proxy  directory   and  are
self-documented. They all make an extensive use of the <I>iptables</I>
command     which     handle      interactions     with     the     <A
HREF="http://netfilter.samba.org/">Netfilter</A> Linux 2.4 module, and
you  may need to  refer to  <I>man iptables</I>  before being  able to
understand how these examples actually work.</P>


<LI><B><A NAME="PortTranslationMethod">Port Translation Method</A></B>

<P>With this method,  not only, ports are opened  in the firewall when
the session  begins and closed when  it ends, but in  addition all the
media flow gets directed through  a specific port. This is useful when
one wants  to put special rules  about SIP media flow  in the firewall
like shaping or logging in a  single set, once and for all. Otherwise,
each time  your script  opens a hole  in the  firewall, is has  to add
these  specific rules  as  well, and  to  remove them  later when  the
session is closed, which can be quite a hassle.</P>

<P>The first task  is to configure the gateway  features of the proxy.
You    can     use    the     same    configuration    as     in    <A
HREF="#NATTransversal">scenario 4</A>.</P>

<P>Then add the  firewall configuration. You can use  the same as with
the <A HREF="PortOpeningMethod">previous  method</A>, and just add the
following tag:</P>

<UL>

<LI><A     HREF="#firewallPortTranslation">firewallPortTranslation</A>:
this is to define the port to which you want all the SIP media flow to
be redirected.

<P>Here is a configuration file example for this scenario:</P>

<PRE>
<font color="#0000FF">enableUDP 5060
stackName caribou.antd.nist.gov
stackAddress 129.6.55.81 192.168.3.1 
gatewayAddress 129.6.55.81
innerNetworkPrefix 192.168.3. 192.168.2.
firewallTransversal DNATBegin.pl DNATEnd.pl
firewallPortTranslation 50600
defaultSessionTimeOut 120
requireTimer
enableRecordRoute</font>
</PRE>

<P>In this example,  we use two Perl scripts to  open and close ports,
respectively    <A    HREF="DNATBegin.pl">DNATBegin.pl</A>   and    <A
HREF="DNATEnd.pl">DNATEnd.pl</A>.  They  are made to be  used with the
firewall defined in  <A HREF="firewall.sh">firewall.sh</A>.  All these
files   can    be   found   in    the   proxy   directory    and   are
self-documented. They all make an extensive use of the <I>iptables</I>
command     which     handle      interactions     with     the     <A
HREF="http://netfilter.samba.org/">Netfilter</A> Linux 2.4 module, and
you  may need to  refer to  <I>man iptables</I>  before being  able to
understand how these examples actually work.</P>

<P>In a nutshell, the only  differences between these two perl scripts
and the two  previous ones, is that they also  add rules that redirect
packets to their original  destination ports, so that the manipulation
is transparent for the receivers.</P>

  <P>( <b>NOTE</b>:&nbsp; If you are familiar with <i>Netfilter</i> and examine
  this code, you might
find it odd&nbsp; to put shaping rules in the <b> PREROUTING</b> table. However,
  from our experience, it is&nbsp; the only way we found to make it
work the way we want.   In <i> Netfilter,</i> a forwarded message goes through
the <b>  PREROUTING</b>  table,  then   the  FORWARD  table  and  finally  the <b>
POSTROUTING</b> table. A more intuitive&nbsp; choice would have been to
put the shaping  rules in the FORWARDING table and  then to change the
destination ports in the <b>  POSTROUTING</b> table.  But, unfortunately, this
is not possible since the only table where one can actually change the
destination port of a message is the <b> PREROUTING</b> one. So, we had to put
there the shaping  rules followed by the <b> DNAT</b> rules. This is a hack! This has been  successfully tested under Linux 2.4.
  Please let us know of your experiences with other configurations.)</P>

<LI><B><A   NAME="Non-colocationWithAFirewall">Non-colocation  with  a
firewall</A></B>

<P>This       case      is       pretty       similar      to       <A
HREF="#FirewallTransversal">scenario  6</A>, but  it  is trickier  and
even harder to configure since it requires some kind of remote control
over the firewall.</P>

<P>However, we  provide two perl scripts  (again) that can  do the job
for  testing   purposes  with  a  very  simple   ad-hoc  protocol:  <A
HREF="firewallControlServer.pl">firewallControlServer.pl</A>  for  the
server                   side                  and                  <A
HREF="firewallControlClient.pl">firewallControlClient.pl</A>  for  the
client side.   They are both self-documented. The  server only accepts
request coming from a list of  trusted clients, reads a full line from
them  (a line  which  is the  command  to be  executed  to change  the
firewall configuration),  accepts it if  it begins with  an authorized
command name  and finally  execute it. On  the other side,  the client
connects to the server and just sends its command line.</P>

<P>Here is a configuration file example for this scenario:</P>

<PRE>
<font color="#0000FF">enableUDP 5060
stackName moose.antd.nist.gov
stackAddress 129.6.55.95 192.168.2.4

firewallTransversal remoteDNATBegin.bat remoteDNATEnd.bat
firewallPortTranslation 50600
defaultSessionTimeOut 120
requireTimer
enableRecordRoute
</font></PRE>

<P>Here, we use two batch files for remote control of the server. They
are             just             wrapper            for             <A
HREF="firewallControlClient.pl">firewallControlClient.pl</A>  that can
be used under Windows, and can be found in the proxy directory.</P>

<P><B>NB</B>:  This  has  been  successfully  tested  with  Linux  2.4
firewall and  remote control  from either Windows  2000 or  Linux PCs.&nbsp;</P>

<H3><A NAME="ExtensionMechanisms">Extension Mechanisms</A></H3>

<P>The NIST-SIP stack and message parser are both extensible.We exploit these
features in the proxy.&nbsp; The following are the extensible features of the
Proxy:</P>

<P><B>Extension headers:</B> Extension headers are handled by 
registering an extension
parser which implements the ExtensionParser interface. An extension is specified
in the configuration file by the keyword extensionParser:</P>

<P><font color="#0000FF">extensionParser Session-Expires&nbsp;
examples.proxy.SessionExpiresParser&nbsp;</font></P>

<P>In future, we will also add the ability to handle extension methods and body
types other than application/sdp (which is the only body type that we support at
present).</P>

<P><B>Customized routing of requests:</B> You can override the default routing
algorithm by providing a customized router. To do this you have to 
implement the gov.nist.sip.stack.Router interface and register the router
at load time by using the defaultRouter keyword.

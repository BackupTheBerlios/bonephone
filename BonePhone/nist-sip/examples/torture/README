This is a set of torture test cases that will be expanded over time. The input 
to these test cases is an xml file called torture.xml. Build this using
gmake Torture and run using make tests.  The output (by default) is an xml
file called testout.xml.  If your browser is xml enabled, you may visualize
the test input and output in nice table format. 

The input file (torture.xml) consists of both correct and erroneous
SIP messages, URLs and headers. The erroneous SIP messages are expected
to generate exceptions. The exceptions that they generate result in an
exception handler being called (see Torture.java). The test engine tests
to see whether exceptions were generated as expected and whether the right
information was presented to the handler on exception.  The format of
the input xml file is self explanatory (see  the comments in torture.xml).

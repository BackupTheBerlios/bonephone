<h1> Parser use examples </h1>
Each of the following tests illustrates a feature of the Parser. The 
tests may be built and executed using the provided makefile (make targets
are indicated):

<h2>
1. PieplinedMsgParserTest (no make target for this one)
</h2>
 Here is an  example  that uses the stream based parser
 (PipelinedMsgParser)  that reads from stdin, parses input and outputs
 the result to stdout (typically, that input would come
 from a TCP connection). A class that implements the SIPMessageListener
 interface is specified when the parser is created. This interface
 specifies two methods processMessage and handeException that are
 invoked by the parser on successful message processing and when a
 parse exception is encountered respectively. The exception handler
 gets passed a SIPParseException  object that indicates whether an
 error was encountered on an individual header or on the entire
 message (which can happen when the RequestLine is malformed or
 when there are multiple headers of a type when there should only
 be a single one). The handleException method can do whatever
 is appropriate for the application (for example a proxy may
 simply choose to ignore malformed headers).  The default action
 is to simply ignore malformed headers and abort  processing on
 malformed messages. When a message has been successfully parsed,
 the processMessage method is called from the parser and it is passed
 a SIPMessage object corresponding to the input that has been read
 from the input stream.

<h2>
2. StringMsgParserTest (make target = stringparse) 
</h2>
 This example reads a file consisting of multiple messages  into  a buffer
 (typically, that input would be from a UDP packet) and parses the input
 by handing that input to the parser.   The parser can take multiple SIP
 Messages in a single buffer and  returns the parsed result as an array
 of SIPMessage objects.  Errors are handled  via a class that implements
 the SIPParseExceptionListener. that can be registered at the time of
 creation of the parser with the setExceptionListener  method of the
 StringMsgParser. This class must implement the handleException method
 that functions as described above. As  above, the  exception listener can
 be set up to customize error handling by introsepcting on the Exception
 class that it is passed when an exception occurs.  

<h2>
3. SIPURLParserTest Illustrates parsing of individual URL's 
(make target = urlparse)
</h2>
This example illustrates how individual URLs may be parsed and output
as a parsed structure.

<h2>
4. NewFangledHeaderTest: (make target = extensionparse)
</h2>
Illustrates parsing of extension headers.  When an unrecognized header
is encountered by the parser, if an ExceptionListener (using the
setExceptionListener call) is registered, its handleException method is
called back and is passed UnrecognizedExtension exception object. At
this time, the exception listener can   Extensions are stored in a
hash table in the SIPMessage and can be retrieved by type by using the
getExtensionHeader method of the SIPMessage class  by specifying the
class of the extension header.

<h2>
5. SIPHeaderParserTest: (make target = headerparse)
</h2>
Illustrates parsing of individual headers.  More callouts to the
parser to parse individual pieces of input may be added as needed by
adding methods to or extending StringMsgParser.

<h2>
6. SDPParseTest : (make target = sdpparse)
</h2>
The parser may also be used to parse SDP headers. This is not particularly
relevant for building servers but may be of use in building UAC clients.
You can turn on parsing SDP headers by enabling the parseMessageContents
flag in the parser. The SDPParserTest shows how to parse SDP Headers.

<h2>
7. BadHeader test: ( make target badheaders)
</h2>
Illustrates error handling 

<h2>
pipeline  parser test (make pipeline)
</h2>
Illustrates the use of the parser in pileine mode. (starts up an interactive
shell where you can input sip messages and it will parse it and output the
result). Gives you an idea of how to use the parser when handling 
stream-oriented (TCP) input.

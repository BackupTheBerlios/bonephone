Beta 7
======
Released 20.04.2000

- There was a bug in the parser that occured when parsing an
  MString that contained escaped characters like NEWLINE or
  quotation marks.
- You can now use the MessageBus class with an address with 
  more or less than 4 address pairs and where the 4th pair 
  must not be the "id".
- The MessageBus class now has an .getTimeout() method.


Beta 6
======
Released 13.03.2000

With some additions from Roman Kurmanowytsch <romank@infosys.tuwien.ac.at>

- Thanks to Romanthe TransportLayer now allows sending several 
  commands at once.
- Thanks to Roman you can now add your own keys to an address.
- There was a bug when sending reliable messages via the
  MessageBus class that causes the MBus to ignore the first
  acknowledgement. That bug is fixed.

Beta 5
======
Released 07.03.2000

- There was a severe bug that wouldn't let the beta4
  compile (requesting for an (unused) package 'org.tzi.mbus.*').
  This is fixed
- Some classes contained hard coded references to the 
  Cryptix API. These references were removed. You now
  have to tell the Mbus what cryptography provider to use
  by setting a system property or key in your .mbus file.
